# Hi I'm Alberto Mtz. de Murga

### _aka. threkk_

I am a Spanish ~~Software Engineer~~ Internet Plumber currently living in **Paris**. I work at [Blue Harvest](https://blueharvest.io) as Lead Engineer and study part-time a Master's degree in Software Engineering at the [University of Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl). I work on full-stack (front end, back end, architecture, cloud) projects using mainly JavaScript, Python and Go.

On my free time, I am interested in books, especially in history, fantasy and science fiction; videogames and eSports, and technology and its applications, especially interested in cryptography and data privacy. Essentially, I am 50% nerd and 50% geek.

I write things, concretely, [short things](https://twitter.com/threkk) about my life, [longer things](https://medium.com/@threkk) about technology, and [open source software](https://github.com/threkk). I also reply to [emails](mailto:hello@threkk.com).
